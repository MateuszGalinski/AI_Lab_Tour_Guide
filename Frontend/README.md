# Frontend of AIGenie

## Description
This is the frontend of AIGenie, a host for the AI Lab of OsloMet University. 
It is a web application that allows users to explore the AI Lab online and get help understanding the various AI topics using an AI Model. 
The frontend is built using Vue and TypeScript, and it is designed to be user-friendly.

## Important
Currently the application is only developed for mobile devices, therefore it the viewport has to be set to a mobile device width in order to see the application correctly.
In future a desktop version should be developed.

    A landscape-oriented banner illustration for an upcoming event about artificial intelligence. 
    The design features warm, inviting tones with prominent use of the yellow color #FED501 in elements like accents, lighting, or background gradients. 
    The composition shows a welcoming atmosphere â€” possibly with abstract AI-inspired visuals such as neural network shapes, futuristic technology motifs, or friendly digital interfaces. 
    Include subtle human presence or silhouettes engaging with technology to emphasize accessibility and connection. 
    The scene should feel modern, inspiring, and creative.
